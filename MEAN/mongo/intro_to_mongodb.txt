1. Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
	show my_first_db

2. Create students collection.
	db.createCollection("students")

3. Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})



4. Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
	> db.students.insert({name: "STRING", home_state: "STRING", lucky_number: "NUMBER", birthday: {month: "NUMBER", day: "NUMBER", year: "NUMBER"}})
	WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
	> db.students.insert({name: "Steve Jobs", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 2, birthday: {month: 7, day: 1, year: 1950}})
	WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
	> db.students.insert({name: "Bill Gates", home_state: "WS", lucky_number: 1, birthday: {month: 2, day: 1, year: 1950}})
	WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
	> db.students.insert({name: "Super man", home_state: "EA", lucky_number: 5, birthday: {month: 8, day: 57, year: 1976}})
	WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
	> db.students.insert({name: "Steve Kim", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 5, birthday: {month: 7, day: 30, year: 1986}})
	WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
	

5. Get all students.
	> db.students.find().pretty()

6. Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
	> db.students.find({home_state: "CA"}).pretty()

7. Get all students whose lucky number is:

7.1 greater than 3
	db.students.find({lucky_number: { $gt: 3}}).pretty()
7.2 less than or equal to 10
	db.students.find({lucky_number: { $lte: 10}}).pretty()
7.3 between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
	db.students.find({lucky_number: { $gte: 1, $lte: 9}}).pretty()

8. Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
	> db.students.updateMany({}, { $addToSet: {interests:{ $each: [ "coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}}})

9. Add some unique interests for each particular students into each of their interest arrays.
	db.students.update({name: "Steve Kim}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"}})

10. Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.


11. Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
	> db.students.update({name: "Steve Kim"}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"}})

12. Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).
	db.students.remove({home_state: "WS"})

13. Remove a user by name. 
	db.students.remove({name: "Super man"})

14. Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
	db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

15. Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.


16. Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).


17. Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'


18. Remove the 'lucky_number' field.


19. Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
